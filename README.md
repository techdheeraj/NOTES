# Encrypted Notes

A web application that stores encrypted notes.

Notes are encrypted in-browser and the password (or passphrase) is never sent to the server -- so you can store secrets online that can only be read by yourself.

Find notes with Sublime Text like *fuzzy* search. Just hit a few keys from the title in the right order to narrow the search.

See the following for a demonstration:

http://notes.moyaproject.com/~will

passphrase `where there is a will`

Feel free to edit that, or create your own notebook:

You might be interested in the backend, which is a simple JSONRPC api:
